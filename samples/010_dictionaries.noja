# Dictionaries are declared just as in Python

some_dict = {

	"name"	: "Francesco",
	"age"	: 22,
	"city"	: "Naples"
}

# keys can only be strings.

# You can access the fields using the [] notation or the -> notation
# The following two statements are equivalent:

print("Hi! I'm ", some_dict["name"]);

print("Hi! I'm ", some_dict->name);
